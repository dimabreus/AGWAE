# AGWAE (A Game Without An Engine)

AGWAE is a basic game framework written in C# that implements core game mechanics and physics from scratch, with a focus on simplicity and manual control over the functionality.

This framework provides essential game features such as scene management, physics, and rendering, without relying on third-party game engines or libraries (except for SFML for window rendering).

## Features

- **Scene Management**: System for managing multiple scenes.
- **Time Management**: `Time.DeltaTime` and fixed updates for consistent frame rates.
- **Layer Management**: Manage different layers for objects in the game.
- **Camera System**: Camera that follows a specific object.
- **GameObject**: Base object with position, rotation, scale, sprite, and other properties.
- **UIObject**: A `GameObject` with click actions.
- **ColliderObject**: `GameObject` with a collider, made of vertices and a debug visualization.
- **RigidbodyObject**: A `ColliderObject` with physics properties for collisions and movement.
- **Tilemap**: System for organizing game objects in a grid for easier placement.

## Physics System

- **Shape**: A collection of vertices and related methods for defining object boundaries.
- **Projection**: A method for projecting shapes along an axis, used in collision detection.
- **SAT (Separating Axis Theorem)**: Main class for detecting collisions and calculating the Minimum Translation Vector (MTV).

## Example

Two simple scenes have been added to demonstrate the framework:
- **SMainMenu**: Main menu of the game.
- **SGameScene**: Example platformer game scene with basic objects and physics.

## Notes

This framework is intended for developers who want to create their own game mechanics and features without relying on pre-built solutions from larger game engines. It is designed to be minimal and flexible, giving you full control over game logic, physics, and rendering.

Currently, there is no visual editorâ€”everything is done through code.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dimabreus/AGWAE.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Install **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for window rendering:
   - Download SFML.Net from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
   - Follow installation instructions for your platform.
